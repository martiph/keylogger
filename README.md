# Keylogger

This is the repository of a experimental implementation of a keylogger. More features will be added (probably). More on Keyloggers and the different methods on how to catch keystrokes can be found on the `[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystroke_logging)` page.

## Installation and Execution

Assuming your current working directory is the directory where this repository resides and `gcc` is installed, use the following command:

```` bash
gcc ./simple_keylogger.c -o simple_keylogger
````

To execute the program just type:

````bash
./simple_keylogger
````

To exit the program press `Ctrl + C`.

## Deinstallation

Just delete `simple_keylogger.c` and `simple_keylogger`
